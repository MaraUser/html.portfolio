<h1>Best Movies According to Me</h1>
<h2>Here are my top 3 picks</h2>

<hr />
<h3>Love Actually</h3>

<p>Best Christmas movie even though it has some flaws (I'm looking at you Wisconsing plotline!)</p>

<h3>The Notebook</h3>
<p>Romantic-kinda, sexy-really? I just like it.</p>

<h3>Rear Window</h3>
<p>Who doesn't love Hitchcock! Add princess Grace, and it's a winner.</p>
